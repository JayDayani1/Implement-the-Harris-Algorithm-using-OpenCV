# Implement-the-Harris-Algorithm-using-OpenCV
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for implementing the Harris corner detection algorithm using OpenCV. The project demonstrates the use of OpenCV to detect corners in images, which is a crucial step in many computer vision tasks.

## Project Description

### Objective

The objective of this project is to implement and demonstrate the Harris corner detection algorithm using OpenCV. The key tasks include:

1. **Image Loading and Display**: Loading images from files and displaying them using OpenCV.
2. **Grayscale Conversion**: Converting the loaded images to grayscale, which is a prerequisite for the Harris algorithm.
3. **Harris Corner Detection**: Applying the Harris corner detection algorithm to identify corners in images.
4. **Result Visualization**: Visualizing the detected corners on the original images.

## File Description

- **Implement the Harris algorithm using OpenCV.ipynb**: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the code, visualizations, and explanations for the project tasks.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `jupyter`

The project involved implementing the Harris corner detection algorithm using OpenCV. The steps were as follows:

**Image Loading and Display**: Images were loaded from files and displayed to verify successful loading.
**Grayscale Conversion**: The images were converted to grayscale as the Harris algorithm operates on single-channel images.
**Harris Corner Detection**: The Harris corner detection algorithm was applied to the grayscale images. This algorithm computes a corner response function for each pixel, which indicates the likelihood of the pixel being a corner.
**Result Visualization**: The corners detected by the algorithm were visualized on the original images by marking them with circles or other markers. This visualization helped to confirm that the algorithm correctly identified the corners.
**The Harris corner detection algorithm** successfully identified corners in the images, demonstrating the capability of OpenCV for corner detection tasks in computer vision.
